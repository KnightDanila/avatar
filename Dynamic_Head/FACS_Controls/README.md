# FACS Definition

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a comprehensive, anatomically based system for describing all visually discernible facial movement. It breaks down facial expressions into individual components of muscle movement, called Action Units (AUs). In studio we represent these action units as Poses that can be controlled via slider in the FaceControls Attribute. Each Pose can be dialed between 0 and 1. By combining different FACS poses you can create expressions. By combining FACS poses overtime you can create facial animation.
