# Rigs
This folder contains FBX files for the most popular R15 bodies found in Roblox games. Developers are welcome to use these templates as a starting point to create custom animations using the Animation Editor in Roblox Studio. If you prefer to animate using a 3rd-party authoring tool, then the final animation can be imported back into Roblox using the Avatar Importer plugin that comes with Roblox Studio.

The sample "Lola" models are part of the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/skinned-meshparts-are-live/831011">Skinned MeshParts</a>. release.
